		<h2>mmblog</h2>
<p>Mon Jan 30 2023</p>
<p>mmblog stands for micro micro blog. It is a tool written in c to create and host your own blog. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/jobutterfly/mmblog">here</a>. The genesis of this idea came when I was browsing <a href="https://noxz.tech">noxz's</a> website and I found <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a>. It seemed like a nice project and I decided to build something similar. I decided to use the C programming language because I wanted to see how the &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; library worked and how easy would it be to build a simple webserver.</p>
<p>mmblog can do three things: create, add, serve. When <code>mmblog create</code> is called, a new text file is created where the blog itself will be stored. When <code>mmblog add &lt;some text here&gt;</code> is called, it creates a new entry in the text file. Finally, when <code>mmblog serve</code> is called, it creates a webserver and it listens to calls according to the port set in the main.c file.</p>
<p>This was my first real project written in C and I'm happy with how it came out. It being my first project in C, I know that it is far from perfect but I will try to improve it as I keep learning. One of the things I learned is that strings in C are really tricky. There is no string type in C so there are two ways of declaring a string in C, either:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *a_string;
</code></pre>
<p>or,</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char another_string[1024];
</code></pre>
<p>I preferred working with with character arrays rather than with character pointers. I felt that it was more intuitive and I didn't need to go through the hassle of having to allocate memory and free the memory when using it. The only problem is that is has a fixed size, but it is not that hard to work around that.</p>
<p>The other thing that I learned while making this project is the importance of the man pages. For many functions like fopen or strcat, by using the available man pages, I was able to grasp how the functions work and what they did with no hassle. I didn't have to open up a browser and search for an answer. This also encouraged me to use more the <code>go doc</code> tool for the go standard library.</p>
